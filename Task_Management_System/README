In the modern, fast-paced world, efficient task management is crucial for enhancing productivity and ensuring timely completion of projects. This mini project aims to develop a robust Task Management System using database management system (DBMS) principles to streamline the process of organizing, assigning, and tracking tasks.

The proposed system will allow users to create and manage tasks, set deadlines, assign tasks to team members, and monitor progress. Key features include user authentication, role-based access control, task prioritization, and notification alerts for upcoming deadlines. The system will also provide detailed reports and analytics to help users understand task distribution and completion rates.

The backend will be implemented using a relational database, ensuring data integrity and enabling complex queries to support the system's functionality. Frontend interfaces will be designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, facilitating easy interaction with the system.
